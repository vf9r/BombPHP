# BombPHP

started working on this a little bit past midnight on april 13th, 2025
some features that i've produced that i think are pretty cool:
- .env parsing
- database instance with driver parameter
- autoloading

plans:
- routing
- custom template engine
- cross-driver compatibility db abstraction
- built in xss/sql injection prevention
- middleware
- curl and soap interfacing
